## RS232Chat_Original
Simple RS-232 relay chat test example. Completed as a part of graduate coursework, left unaltered upon completion.

This application was completed in a graduate course on laboratory automation.
It is a simple, contrived example of using .NET for RS-232 communication.

The application is meant to demonstrate RS-232 communication using an outgoing connection doubled back on itself.
The result is a "chat" application which sends and receives text on the same window.

Code as presented here is left unmodified from the state it was in when submitted for grading.
This code has been uploaded as part of an ongoing refactoring project.
**A refactored version of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/paynerg2/RS232Chat).**
